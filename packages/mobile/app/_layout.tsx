 * the user is most likely to be staring at the screen waiting for
 * the timer to fire. Setting the handler at module load (above the
 * default export) is the legacy pattern from
 * persistence-mobile/app/_layout.tsx:25-53 and matches Expo's
 * documented setup.
 *
 * The handler still respects `Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync`
 * — if the user denied permission, the OS suppresses the banner
 * regardless of what we return here. The rest-timer's in-app
 * countdown remains visible as the fallback.

 * possible-prompt feels native on iOS (every well-known app does it
 * at launch) and avoids the staging-build behaviour where the user
 * never sees the prompt at all unless they happen to navigate to
 * the home screen.
 *
 * The hook owns idempotency: an AsyncStorage flag + in-memory ref
 * mean the OS prompt only fires the very first launch of a fresh
 * install. Subsequent launches read the flag and no-op.
 *
 * Sibling to `AuthGate` rather than baked into it because
 * notifications and auth are independent concerns — keep the
 * coupling visible at the layout level.
